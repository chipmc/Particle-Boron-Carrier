# Particle-Boron-Carrier-v1.7
This is a carrier board for 3rd Generation Particle Devices (Boron and Argon).  It is intended to support use in outdoor environments and remote locations.  It includes the following capabiltities:
* ESD and Short protection (Fuse, TVS and Varistors)
* Support for Solar charging (Large by-pass cap on DC-In and TMP-32 temp sensor to manage safe charging)
* Programmable Watchdog timer (AB1805)
* Real Time Clock with backup to the main LiPO battery (AB1805)
* On/Off switch using a high-side P-MOSFETS
* User Button for custom usage
* Connectors for IO including compantibility with Spankfun Qwiic and Adafruit Stemma (JST ST/SR)
